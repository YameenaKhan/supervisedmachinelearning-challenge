# Supervised Machine Learning Challenge
Repository contains solution to HW19
<br>

## Contents of the Repository
1. Resources - Folder contains the CSV from where the data has been read 
2. Jupyter Notebook : Contains code, prediction and analysis on the result

## Initial Prediction
As per my prediction Logistic Regression Model would work better and have a better score for this particular dataset as this dataset is numerical and has less noise variable as most of the information would be coming from the borrower's loan account/profile. Random Forest Classification is known to perform better on categorical data and data that may have significant amount of outliers/ noise variables.


## Results
As per the both Model Scores, my prediction proves to be correct. The testing score of Logistic Regression Model is 0.993 which is better than the score of Random Forest Classifier which is 0.991, this suggests that since the data set is very straight forward and completely numerical and has no categorial fields. I believe it is the nature of the data set selected that suggests why Logistic Regression Model worked better.
